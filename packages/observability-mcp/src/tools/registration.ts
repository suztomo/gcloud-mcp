          For more information, see Logging query language (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language).

          An empty filter matches all log entries in the resources listed in resource_names.
          Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in resource_names will cause the filter to return no results.
          To make queries faster, you can make the filter more selective by using restrictions on indexed fields (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language#indexed-fields) as well as limit the time range of the query by adding range restrictions on the timestamp field.

          - To find logs from a specific GCE instance: 'resource.type="gce_instance" AND resource.labels.instance_id="1234567890123456789"'
          - To find logs containing a specific text message: 'textPayload:"database connection failed"'
          - To find logs within a specific time range: 'timestamp >= "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND timestamp < "2025-01-01T01:00:00Z"'`,
