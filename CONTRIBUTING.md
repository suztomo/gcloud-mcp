# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Submissions by non-Googlers require
two reviewers. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Multi-Approvers Check

Each pull request must be approved by two Googlers. This is enforced by an
automated multi-approvers check. This check may not automatically re-run
after the second approval is added. If it remains in a failed state, you
can manually re-trigger it by:

1. Clicking "View details" on the failed workflow to bring you to the "Actions" page.
2. Clicking "Re-run failed jobs".

For more information, see [Re-running failed jobs in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs#re-running-failed-jobs-in-a-workflow).

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

The section above follows the standard googleapis organization’s
CONTRIBUTING.md template. The section below is specific to the gcloud-mcp
project. It explains how we work, how we use GitHub, and what contributors can
expect when engaging with this repository.

## Contribution Process

### Before contributing code

Before doing any significant work, open an issue to propose your idea and
ensure alignment. You can either
[file a new issue](https://github.com/googleapis/gcloud-mcp/issues/new/choose), or comment
on an [existing one](https://github.com/googleapis/gcloud-mcp/issues).

A pull request (PR) that does not go through this coordination process may be
closed to avoid wasted effort.

Make sure your code follows the guidelines at
[How We Write Typescript](doc/how-we-write-typescript.md).

## Checking the issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track tasks, bugs, and discussions.

All changes, except trivial ones, should start with a GitHub issue. This process gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps prevent duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits inside the goals for the language and tools. It also checks that the design is sound before code is written; the code review tool is not the place for high-level discussions.

Always include a clear description in the body of the issue. The description should provide enough context for any team member to understand the problem or request without needing to contact you directly for clarification.

## Sending a pull request

All code changes must go through a pull request. First-time contributors should review [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

Before sending a pull request, it should include tests if there are logic changes, copyright headers in every file, and a commit message following the conventions in "Commit messages" section below.

A pull request can be opened from a branch within the repository or from a fork. External contributors are only able to open pull requests from forks, but team members with write access can choose to open a pull request from a repository branch.

If you open a pull request from a personal fork, you should allow repository maintainers to make edits to your fork by turning on "Allow edits from maintainers".
Please see [creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) in the official GitHub documentation for details.

## Commit messages

Commit messages for gcloud-mcp follow the conventions below.
Here is an example:

```
feat(internal/gcloud-mcp): add version subcommand

A version subcommand is added to gcloud-mcp, which prints the current version of
the tool.

The version follows the versioning conventions described at
https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions.

Fixes https://github.com/googleapis/gcloud-mcp/issues/12345
```

### First line

The first line of the change description is a short one-line summary of the
change, following the structure `<type>(<package>): <description>`:

#### type

A structural element defined by the conventions at
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary.

#### package

The name of the package affected by the change, and should be provided in
parentheses before the colon.

#### description

A short one-line summary of the change, that should be written to complete
the sentence "This change modifies gcloud-mcp to ..." That means it does not
start with a capital letter, is not a complete sentence, and actually
summarizes the result of the change. Note that the verb after the colon is
lowercase, and there is no trailing period

The first line should be kept as short as possible (many git viewing tools
prefer under ~76 characters).

Follow the first line by a blank line.

### Main content

The rest of the commit message should provide context for the change and
explain what it does. Write in complete sentences with correct punctuation.
Don't use HTML, Markdown, or any other markup language.

Add any relevant information, such as benchmark data if the change affects
performance. The benchstat tool is conventionally used to format benchmark data
for change descriptions.

### Referencing issues

The special notation "Fixes #12345" associates the change with issue 12345 in
the gcloud-mcp issue tracker. When this change is eventually applied, the issue
tracker will automatically mark the issue as fixed.

If the change is a partial step towards the resolution of the issue, write
"For #12345" instead. This will leave a comment in the issue linking back
to the pull request, but it will not close the issue when the change is
applied.

Please don’t use alternate GitHub-supported aliases like Close or Resolves
instead of Fixes.

## Filing a new issue

All changes, except trivial ones, should start with a GitHub issue.

This process gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps prevent
duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits inside the goals for the
language and tools. It also checks that the design is sound before code is
written; the code review tool is not the place for high-level discussions.

Significant changes must go through a design review process before they are
accepted.

All issues should have a path prefix to indicate the relevant domain. For
issues related to the gcloud-mcp codebase, use the package name as a prefix (for
example, `gcloud-mcp:` or `cli:`). For issues related to code outside this
repository, use the repository name (for example, `google-cloud-python`).

Aside from proper nouns, issue titles should use lowercase.

Always include a clear description in the body of the issue. The description
should provide enough context for any team member to understand the problem or
request without needing to contact you directly for clarification.

Default to assigning the issue to someone if there’s a clear owner. Otherwise,
leave it for triage.

## The review process

This section explains the review process in detail and how to approach reviews
after a pull request has been sent for review.

### Getting a code review

Before creating a pull request, make sure that your commit message follows the
suggested format. Otherwise, it can be common for the pull request to be sent
back with that request without review.

After creating a pull request, request a specific reviewer if relevant, or leave it for
the default group.

### Merging a pull request

Pull request titles and descriptions must follow the [commit messages](#commit-messages)
conventions. This enables approvers to review the final commit message. Once the pull
request has been approved and all checks have passed, click the
[Squash and Merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits)
button. The resulting commit message will be based on the pull request's title and
description.

### Reverting a pull request

If a merged pull request needs to be undone, for reasons such as breaking the build, the
standard process is to [revert it through the GitHub interface](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/reverting-a-pull-request).

To revert a pull request:

1.  Navigate to the merged pull request on GitHub.
2.  Click the **Revert** button. This action automatically creates a new branch and a pull request containing the revert commit.
3.  Edit the pull request title and description to comply with the [commit message guidelines](#commit-messages).
4.  The newly created revert pull request should be reviewed and merged following the same process as any other pull request.

Using the GitHub "Revert" button is the preferred method over manually creating a revert commit using `git revert`.

### Keeping the pull request dashboard clean

We aim to keep https://github.com/googleapis/gcloud-mcp/pulls clean so that we
can quickly notice and review incoming changes that require attention.

Given that goal, please do not open a pull request unless you are ready for a
code review. Draft pull requests and ones without author activity for more than
one business day may be closed (they can always be reopened later).

If you're still working on something, continue iterating on your branch without
creating a pull request until it’s ready for review.

### Addressing code review comments

Creating additional commits to address reviewer feedback is generally preferred
over amending and force-pushing. This makes it easier for reviewers to see what
has changed since their last review.

Pull requests are always squashed and merged. Before merging, please review and
edit the resulting commit message to ensure it clearly describes the change.

After pushing,
[click the button](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members)
to ask a reviewer to re-request your review.

## Leaving a TODO

When adding a TODO to the codebase, always include a link to an issue, no
matter how small the task.

Use the format:

```
// TODO(https://github.com/googleapis/gcloud-mcp/issues/<number>): explain what needs to be done
```

This helps provide context for future readers and keeps the TODO relevant and
actionable as the project evolves.
