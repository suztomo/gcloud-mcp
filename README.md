# gcloud MCP Server ☁️

The gcloud [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) server enables AI assistants to easily interact with the Google Cloud environment using the gcloud CLI. With the gcloud MCP you can:

- **Interact with Google Cloud using natural language.** Describe the outcome you want instead of memorizing complex command syntax, flags, and arguments.
- **Automate and simplify complex workflows.** Chain multiple cloud operations into a single, repeatable command to reduce manual effort and the chance of error.
- **Lower the barrier to entry for cloud management.** Empower team members who are less familiar with gcloud to perform powerful actions confidently and safely.

## 📡 Available MCP Servers

This repository also hosts other MCP servers in addition to the gcloud MCP server. An up to date list is below, and links to other Google Cloud MCP servers hosted outside of this repo are [here](#-other-google-cloud-mcp-servers).

| MCP Server Name | Description                                                                   | Package Name              |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| gcloud          | Interact with Google Cloud via the gcloud CLI using natural language prompts. | `gcloud-mcp`              |
| observability   | An MCP server for interacting with Google Cloud Observability APIs.           | `cloud-observability-mcp` |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): version 20 or higher
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

## ✨ Set up your MCP server

### Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist

To integrate gcloud MCP with Gemini CLI or Gemini Code Assist, you can run a single setup command. This will configure it as a [Gemini CLI extension](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/extension.md).

Run this command from your project's root directory (for a single project) or your home directory (for all projects) for each MCP server you would like to install from the list above:

```shell
npx @google-cloud/[PACKAGE_NAME] init --agent=gemini-cli
```

For example, for gcloud:

```shell
npx @google-cloud/gcloud-mcp init --agent=gemini-cli
```

See [Local Development](doc/DEVELOPMENT.md) for help installing from source.

After the initialization process, you can verify that the gcloud-mcp server is configured correctly by running the following command:

```
gemini mcp list

> ✓ gcloud: npx -y @google-cloud/gcloud-mcp (stdio) - Connected
```

### For other AI clients

To use MCP servers in this repo with other clients, add the following snippet to their respective JSON configuration files for each MCP server:

```json
"[SERVER_NAME]": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/[PACKAGE_NAME]"]
}
```

For example, for gcloud:

```json
"gcloud": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/gcloud-mcp"]
}
```

Instructions for popular tools:

- **Claude Desktop:** Open **Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config** and edit `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- **Cline:** Click the MCP Servers icon, then **Configure MCP Servers** to edit `cline_mcp_settings.json`.
- **Cursor:** Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` for a single project or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for all projects.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Edit `.vscode/mcp.json` for a single project or your global user settings file for all projects.
- **Gemini CLI (Manual Setup):** If not using extensions, edit `.gemini/settings.json` for a single project or `~/.gemini/settings.json` for all projects.

For **Visual Studio Code** edit the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace for a single project or your global user settings file for all projects:

```json
"servers": {
  "[SERVER_NAME]": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/[PACKAGE_NAME]"]
  }
}
```

For example, for gcloud and observability:

```json
"servers": {
  "gcloud": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/gcloud-mcp"]
  },
  "observability": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/cloud-observability-mcp"]
  },
}
```

## 🔑 MCP Permissions

The permissions of the gcloud MCP are directly tied to the permissions of the gcloud user. To restrict permissions and operate with the principle of least privilege, you can [authorize as a service account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#service-account) and assign the service account a [role with limited permissions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview).

By default, gcloud MCP denies commands deemed unsafe for agents. See [denylist.md](doc/denylist.md) for more information.
